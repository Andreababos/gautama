        "headline" : "Our story",
        "text": "Our team was celebrating a reunion after a few months without seeing each other at our favorite bar back in December 2016. As it usually happens after a couple of beers, one of us asked the always important question: “Who’s gonna roll?” While we do not remember who rolled on that one lucky night, we do remember that during all the necessary preparation we realized that none of us had a crusher or anything that could be used as a mixing tray. At the same time, we realized that despite many products available on the market, there was still a need for a product that would simplify the daily life of a smoker. If such a product did exist, it was not easy to find. So before our “masterpiece” of the evening was finished, with an all in one combined product containing rolling papers, a filter, tray and a crusher, all of which can fit comfortably in a single pocket. From that moment on, inventing new products that are convenient and distinctive became our nighttime entertainment (a daily ritual). This small activity that we would partake in is how our company Gautama Group s.r.o. became established. We are here to provide innovative solutions to an area of products that have been nearly unchanged for decades. "
