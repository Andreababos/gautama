        "headline" : "Our story",
        "text": "Our team was celebrating a reunion after a few months without seeing each other at our favorite bar back in December 2016. As it usually happens after a couple of beers, one of us asked the always important question: “Who’s gonna roll?” While we do not remember who the lucky one to roll was, we do remember that during all the necessary preparation it was realized that none of us had a crusher or anything that could be used as a mixing tray. At the same time, we realized that despite many products available on the market, there was still a need for something that would simplify the daily life of a smoker even more, and if there was such a product, it was not easy to find. So before our “masterpiece” of the evening was finished, we came up with an idea of rolling papers which contain a filter, tray and crusher all in one  package that can fit comfortably in a pocket. From this moment on, inventing new products like this became our nighttime entertainment. This small activity that we would partake in is how our company Gautama Group s.r.o. became established. We are here to provide innovative solutions to an area of products that have been nearly unchanged for decades. "
